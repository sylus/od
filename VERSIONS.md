## Open Data Release Tags

Open Data uses a three-part semantic versioning nomenclature within the
constraints of drupal.org's current capabilities. See
[this drupal.org issue](https://www.drupal.org/node/1612910) for the latest.

The three parts of our versioning system are MAJOR.FEATURE.SPRINT. However, due
to the current constraints of drupal.org, there is no separator between the
FEATURE and SPRINT digits. This also limits Open Data to ten sprint releases
before releasing a new feature.

Given the following tag: 8.x-2.15:

|       |                              |
|-------|------------------------------|
| __8__ | Major version of Drupal Core |
| __x__ |  |
| __2__ | Major version of Open Data |
| __1__ | Feature release of Open Data. Also increments with minor core releases. |
| __5__ | Sprint release between feature releases |

Open Data typically makes a sprint release every four weeks. We'll also use
sprint releases to package new minor releases of Drupal Core with Open Data as
they become available. When this happens, we will also increment the feature
release/minor version number of Open Data - about once every six months.
